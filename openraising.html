        <h4>Stats to Look at</h4>
        <p2>When action is folded to you, there are two players you should be primarily concerned with. The button is the best position in the game, and therefore players will play back from that position most frequently. As a result, you should look at the button statistics in order to adjust your range. If the player is aggressive, open tighter, and if they are tight, you can open wide. The same can be said for the BB, as they are the player you will most likely be involved in a hand with. Inherently, this sort of ideology can be applied to opening from EP, as you have lots of potential aggresors behind, you must open very tight. As you get closer to the button, you can adjust your range more and more based on the BU and BB statistics.</p1>
    </div>
    <div class="two">
        <h4>Ranges by Position</h4>
        <p2>Early position ranges MUST be static. Simply stick to charts, and when in doubt about anything, tight is right. Use your pre-flop charts as a base, then adjust based on exploitative play. You can widen your range significantly and even play garbage due to the implied skill gap. When looking at other player's statistics, 24/20/7 (VPIP/PFR/3B) or less is very tight. Exploiting these statistics are essential to making money, and you can use the following rules to adjust your ranges and play accordingly. Loose aggressive player behind = Tight, Tight player behind = Loose, Loose and passive player= Tight and playable range, Fish in blind = Loose, Tight/Weak regs in blinds = Loose, Aggressive regs = Tighter, use blockers especially when short, No information = Standard static chart ranges</p2>

    <div class="three">
        <h4>SB & BB Play</h4>
        <p2>From the BU and SB, you have very few people left to act so you get to play a LOT of hands. Against extremely agressive opponents, you still open 40% of hands, and against extremely tight opponents, you get to open a whopping 90% of hands. I personally use a 3x sizing from the BU and 3.5x sizing from the SB in order to generate fold equity and protect my range. However, against extremely good players, I recommend expanding the limp rang from both positions to reduce variance while still allowing yourself to play postflop. </p2>

        <h4>Stack Size Implications</h4>
        <p2>Ranges must be adaptable to constantly changing stack sizes, and this is one of the most complex areas of Poker. Playing at 10BB effective vs 200BB effective is almost a completely different game, but how exactly should we be adjusting? Due to its complexity, the change in ranges may not be static. However, by following these general suggestions, you will be ahead of the game in adjustmenting for changing stack sizes. As stacks shorten, decrease the amount of suited connectors you play. Your cards want to be primarily broadway dense, as even if they are raise-folds, they hold blockers to hands opponents would be jamming. What this means is the overall tightening up even more across positions, and reducing the amount of raise folds you have. The key here is being aware of re-jam stacks behind you and choosing hands that can call off against re-jam stacks. Players who pay attention to all the details at the poker table inherently perform better, as there decisions are based off more information and are simply better.</p2>

        <h4>Recommendations on How to Improve</h4>
        <p2>The most important thing to do is work with pre-flop charts. These charts are a great base to your game, and many people have never seriosuly studied any sort of charts. Furthermore, you can get into pre-flop solutions with ICMIZER and other software tools. The most important thing is exploitative play, which simply requires a large quantity of hands to get the hang of. To improve this, always be thinking about what adjustments you should be making to your range based on your table. By playing a good pre-flop game, you make post-flop much easier for yourself and you can watch the money pour in!</p2>
