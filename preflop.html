  <h1>Importance of Understanding Ranges and using Charts</h1>
  <p2>Preflop charts, while they can do harm if overused, are a great way to play against players you have limited/no information on. This is most players first step towards becoming profitable, and if you are playing micro stakes they will enable you to consistently win. However, it is important to constantly be thinking about other table conditions, along with others perception of yourself, along with the fact ranges change and adapt as stack sizes change. Each chart simply displays what you can open from each position, but is limited due to the fact people may open before you and 3-bet after you.</p2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>UTG (Under the Gun)</h2>
  <p3>UTG has the tightest range at the table as they have<br> 8 players left to act behind, increasing the likelihood<br> of 3-bets. There is no reason to ever expand this<br> range, and this chart should become ingrained in<br> your head. Only open these hands, any wider you<br> will be leaking small amounts of money. Most<br> people don't play this tight UTG, but it is<br> counterintuitive not to.</p3>

  <br><br><br>
  <h3>UTG + 1</h3>
  <p4>UTG+1 is similar to UTG in that you should be<br> following the chart closely no matter what. You<br> only add a few hands, as 7 people left behind to act<br> is still a lot. </p4>

  <br><br><br>
  <h4>UTG + 2</h4>
  <p5>UTG + 2 you add a few more hands, but no drastic<br> strategy change. This position is still classed under<br> EP, and should be played as such.</p5>

  <br><br><br>
  <h5>MP (Middle Position)</h5>
  <p6>MP is where you begin to see significant adjustments<br> to the range and where it becomes more flexible. You<br> can play more suited connectors, and if the table is<br> extremely soft you can expand this range even further.<br> Two of the remaining six players left behind are out<br> of position of you post-flop, enabling you to peel<br> more when 3-bet.</p6>

  <br><br><br>
  <h6>HJ (Hijack)</h6>
  <p7>HJ is still in the MP family, so the strategy from this<br> position is similar to the last with a few more lower<br> suited connectors. Almost all suited kings are raises at<br> this point too, a range I feel most players don't have<br> adapted to their game.</p7>

  <br><br><br>
  <h6>CO (Cutoff)</h6>
  <p8>CO is now in what is considered Late Position, which<br> is the most advantage position in poker. Unless the<br> Button plays, you are guarenteed to be playing in<br> position postflop, and there are only three players<br> behind who can play back at you. As a result, ranges<br> expand shockingly wide, and you can play about 50%<br> of hands profitably.</p8>

  <br><br><br>
  <h6>BU (Button)</h6>
  <p9>BU is the best position in the game as no matter what,<br> you will be in position postflop. Furthermore, you get to<br> see what the 6 people before you do. Due to this, when<br> folded to you, your range MUST be extremely wide in<br> order to capture the dead money in the middle.</p9>

  <img class="dealer" src="images/dealer.jpg" title="Dealer Position" alt="Dealer Position IMG">
  <br><br><br>
  <h6>SB (Small Blind)</h6>
  <p10>The most important thing to note about this SB chart, is<br> that this is the range of hands you want to be playing if<br> folded to you, not necessarily raising. SB strategy is<br> much more complex, as you should have limp traps, raise<br> bluffs, and an overall more intricate strategy. If the hand<br> is on this chart, then at the very least limp to the BB.</p10>
