        <h4>Golden Rules of Flatting and 3-Betting</h4>
        <p2>If Fish behind EV of flat calling increases= 3-bet less, Regs behind EV of flat calling decreases = 3-bet more, Fish three bet thinner for value = DON'T 3-BET BLUFF, The deeper you are = More suited heavy and connectivity you flat, The shorter you are = More broadway highcard heavy flats, EP = Very few 3-bets or even none. These rules allow you to navigate player types and stack depth but require a lot of attention.</p2>

        <h4>3-Bet Bluffing</h4>
        <p2>3-Bet bluffing is the exciting, ganster play that people love to watch on tevevised Poker games. It creates big pots and tought spots for opponents. Despite this, I advocate for limiting your 3-bet bluffs when you are at a soft table. They will not work nearly as often, and it becomes hard to play post-flop against an undefined range. However, when playing against competent opponents, I love 3-betting the right spots. I primarily choose the spots that either look strong or have multiple ways to make +EV plays. For example, against strong players, if I have not 3-bet much I can 3-bet a pretty wide range in the BB, as my perceived range will be EXTREMELY tight given position and statistics. Secondly, 3-betting standard players in position can be very advantageous because you oftentimes take it down post-flop. 3-Betting as a whole requires intensive attention to detail in table dyanmics. Be aware of opponents perception, as it is more important than your own.</p2>

        <h4>The Key to Flatting</h4>
        <p2>If there is one thing you takeaway from this article, it should be that you should flat any playable hand in position of a fish. Playing against fish (extremely bad players) will make you more money than anything else, and if you are confident in your game you will certainly be able to outplay fish postflop.</p2>

        <h4>VPIPing</h4>
        <p2>VPIPing is largely dependent on your table, and you must be aware of this. Against a table that are all aggressive fish, you can tighten up considerably in comparison to a table with only one or two aggressive fish. Against passive fish, VPIP much more and ramp up the agression. You should not have a set playstyle, your opponents playstyle should determine your own.</p2>

    <div class="five">
        <h4>How to Improve 3-Betting</h4>
        <p2>Practice three-bet bluffing and take note of spots it works and does not. Try and have above a 7% 3-bet percentage, balanced efficiently with bluffs and value.</p2>
