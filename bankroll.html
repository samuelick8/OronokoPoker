        <h4>Getting Started</h4>
        <p2>If you are just getting in to Poker, I recommend playing the smallest stakes you can find. .01-.02 cent has been invaluable to my poker journey by allowing me the financial freedom to get in as many hands as I want. When you first start, it is highly unlikely you will be profitable for atleast a year, and to mitigate this, play as tiny as possible!</p2>
    </div>
    <div class="two">
        <h4>Cash Game Bankroll</h4>
        <p2>There are varying opinions on how many buy-ins you need to play a stake of cash. For me, personally, I find value in being able to shrug of any swings, so I recommend never playing a cash game without 40+ buyins. This will allow you to cope with variance and you should never go broke with a good winnrate.</p2>
    </div>
    <div class="three">
        <h4>Tournament Bankroll</h4>
        <p2>Tournaments have higher variance than cash games, and therefore you need more buy-ins. I have personally felt the swings of tournament poker, and it is soul crushing. In order to remain sain, I recommend at least having 200+ buy-ins to play tournaments.</p2>
    </div>
    <div class="four">
        <h4>Discipline</h4>
        <p2>I firmly believe the most important attribute of a serious poker player is discipline. This will keep you from spewing buy-in after buy-in out of tilt, keep your bankroll tightly managed, and allow you to play comfortably. Without structure and discipline, bankrolls that took months to build can be crumbled in days.</p2>
    </div>
    <div class="five">
        <h4>Setting Goals and Challenges</h4>
        <p2>In order to stay motivated, keep track of, and continually improve, I recommend setting challenges and goals for yourself. This will structure you bankroll and force you to improve to move up in stakes. A good target winnrate for Cashgames is 7+ BB/100 hands, and for tournaments anything over 10% ROI is outstanding.</p2>
