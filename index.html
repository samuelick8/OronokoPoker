    <h3>Who is OronokoPoker?</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p1>I discovered Poker my Freshman year of college playing in a dorm with my friends, and I instantly fell in love. At the beginning of 2020, I binked a 5k score and realized I could potentially make a living from Poker, so the grind started. Over the next year, I consumed as much content as I possibly could, took courses, and thought about Poker constantly. I have worked my way up from playing $1 tournaments and cash games to having over 10k in my bankroll. My biggest accomplishment to date is beating .25 .50 cent 9-Max NLHE for 50k hands with a 8BB/100 winrate. This challenge took exactly a month and I profited just under $4,000. I am currently considering what I want to pursue next while focusing on school, but I have my eyes on beating mid-stakes SNG's. This website is dedicated to documenting my journey, along with takeaways and advice to others trying to accomplish similar goals.</p1>
